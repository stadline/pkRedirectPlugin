A simple way to add redirects from URLs on your site to other URLs on your site or elsewhere.

This plugin uses a Symfony filter class to implement the redirects, so they always "win" over other
actions and routes on your site. 

To enable this plugin:

1. Add it to the list of enabled plugins in your ProjectConfiguration class.
2. Enable the pkRedirect module in settings.yml.
3. Add a new filter to the top of your filters.yml:

# Comes first so nothing can trump it
pkRedirect:
  class: pkRedirectFilter

4. If you are adding this to an existing site, generate a migrations diff BEFORE you
rebuild your model classes:

./symfony doctrine:generate-migrations-diff

5. Check the resulting migration class in lib/migrations/doctrine, Doctrine migrations 
generation has some bugs, make sure it doesn't drop all your tables (: (this has nothing
to do with this plugin, but you should be careful)

6. ./symfony doctrine:migrate

7. ./symfony doctrine:build --all-classes

8. ./symfony cc

9. Add a link to the pk_redirect route somewhere

10. Start adding and using redirects. 

That's it!
